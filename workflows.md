# Description

Once a genome has been assembled, it is important to assess the quality of the assembly, and in the first instance, this quality control (QC) can be achieved using this workflow: more details can be found in [the How-to Guide](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/how-to-guides/genome_assembly/assembly_qc).
